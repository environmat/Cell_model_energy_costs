# Cell_model_energy_costs
This file is a basic script to calculate the energy and costs for the raw materials used in a battery. 

It is based on a Julia Script from [M. Laceys - Cellmodels](https://github.com/mjlacey/cellmodels), I mainly transformed it into Python and added some sections regarding the costs estimations for the raw materials. 

It includes the tools for the analysis of a:  
- Cylindrical 
- Pouch 
- Prismatic (wounded) 
cell. 

It aims to give an *initial indication* of what is possible, what could be achieved and the related costs based on only the raw materials. There are no processing costs included for the manufacturing of the batteries.
